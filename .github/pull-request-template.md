# Scope

_What problem or issue does this pull request solve. Please link corresponding github issue [Github Dev Board](https://github.com/orgs/CruzHacks/projects/2)_

# Implementation

_Some description of HOW you achieved it. Perhaps give a high level description of the program flow. Did you need to refactor something? What tradeoffs did you take? Are there things in here which youâ€™d particularly like people to pay close attention to?_

# Images/Important Notes (optional):

_Insert any notes/issues, dependencies added or removed, or images_

# How to Test

_A straightforward scenario of how to test your changes could help colleagues that are not familiar with the part of the code that you are changing but want to see it in action. This section can include a description or step-by-step instructions of how to get to the state of v2 that your change affects._

_A "How To Test" section can look something like this:_

- Sign in with a user with tracks
- Activate `show_awesome_cat_gifs` feature (add `?feature.show_awesome_cat_gifs=1` to your URL)
- You should see a GIF with cats dancing
